# Image Classification System ðŸ§ 

This is a full-stack web application that uses a deep learning model to classify images uploaded by the user. It serves as a great portfolio piece, demonstrating a strong understanding of **machine learning, API development, and full-stack web development**.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Image Upload**: Users can easily upload an image from their device.
* **AI Prediction**: The back-end uses a pre-trained TensorFlow/Keras model to predict the image's category.
* **Client-Server Communication**: The front-end communicates with the Python back-end to send the image and receive the prediction.
* **Dynamic Results**: The classification result is displayed dynamically without page reloads.

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

* **Front-end**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Back-end**: Python with the **Flask** framework
* **Machine Learning**: **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for building and serving the image classification model.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1.  **Clone the Repository**: Clone this project to your local machine.
2.  **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and run `pip install Flask tensorflow`.
3.  **Download a Model**: Obtain a pre-trained image classification model (e.g., from TensorFlow Hub) and save it in your project directory. Update the `model_path` variable in `app.py`.
4.  **Start the Server**: Run the command `python app.py`. The server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
5.  **Open in Browser**: Open your browser and navigate to the server address to use the application.

This project is a fantastic way to stand out by showing you can build and deploy a real-world machine learning application.
